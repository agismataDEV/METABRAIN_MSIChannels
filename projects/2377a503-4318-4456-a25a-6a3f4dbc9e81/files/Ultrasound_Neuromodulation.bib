Here, we show that TRPP2 and TRPC1 assemble to form a channel with a unique constellation of new and TRPP2/TRPC1-specific properties. TRPP2/TRPC1 is activated in response to G-protein-coupled receptor activation and shows a pattern of single-channel conductance, amiloride sensitivity and ion permeability distinct from that of TRPP2 or TRPC1 alone. Native TRPP2/TRPC1 activity is shown in kidney cells by complementary gain-of-function and loss-of-function experiments, and its existence under physiological conditions is supported by colocalization at the primary cilium and by co-immunoprecipitation from kidney membranes. Identification of the heteromultimeric TRPP2/TRPC1 channel has implications in mechanosensation and cilium-based Ca               2+               signalling.},

Posttranscriptional (alternative splicing, editing, and alternative translation initiation) and posttranslational mechanisms (glycosylation, phosphorylation) further increase diversity. For multimeric channels, various heteromeric combinations may raise the number of ion channels to thousands. Here, we show that mixing and matching TWIK1-related K               +               (TREK)/Twik-related acid-arachidonic activated K               +               channel (TRAAK) subunits generate tens of different channels. Heterodimeric combinations have properties different from those of the corresponding homodimers, including single-channel behavior, regulation by kinases, and sensitivity to pharmacological agents. These results imply that any excitable cell can adjust its response to neurotransmitters by simply modulating the ratio of expressed TREK/TRAAK subunits. These results also imply that heteromerization has to be considered when analyzing in vivo functions of these channels but also when screening new potential therapeutic drugs.                        ,                             The tandem of pore domain in a weak inwardly rectifying K               +               channel (Twik)-related acid-arachidonic activated K               +               channel (TRAAK) and Twik-related K               +               channels (TREK) 1 and TREK2 are active as homodimers gated by stretch, fatty acids, pH, and G protein-coupled receptors. These two-pore domain potassium (K               2P               ) channels are broadly expressed in the nervous system where they control excitability. TREK/TRAAK KO mice display altered phenotypes related to nociception, neuroprotection afforded by polyunsaturated fatty acids, learning and memory, mood control, and sensitivity to general anesthetics. These channels have emerged as promising targets for the development of new classes of anesthetics, analgesics, antidepressants, neuroprotective agents, and drugs against addiction. Here, we show that the TREK1, TREK2, and TRAAK subunits assemble and form active heterodimeric channels with electrophysiological, regulatory, and pharmacological properties different from those of homodimeric channels. Heteromerization occurs between all TREK variants produced by alternative splicing and alternative translation initiation. These results unveil a previously unexpected diversity of K               2P               channels that will be challenging to analyze in vivo, but which opens new perspectives for the development of clinically relevant drugs.},

In animal cells, shape changes are primarily driven by the cellular cortex, a thin actomyosin network that lies directly underneath the plasma membrane. Myosin-generated forces create tension in the cortical network, and gradients in tension lead to cellular deformations. Recent studies have provided important insight into the molecular control of cortical tension by progressively unveiling cortex composition and organization. In this Cell Science at a Glance article and the accompanying poster, we review our current understanding of cortex composition and architecture. We then discuss how the microscopic properties of the cortex control cortical tension. While many open questions remain, it is now clear that cortical tension can be modulated through both cortex composition and organization, providing multiple levels of regulation for this key cellular property during cell and tissue morphogenesis.},

Coste                 et al.                              (p.               55               , published online 2 September) used RNA interference to decrease expression of candidate genes systematically in a mouse neuroblastoma cell line and identified two genes that encode proteins, Piezo1 and Piezo2, which are required for mechanically stimulated cation conductance in these cells and in cultured dorsal root ganglion neurons. Similar proteins are expressed in a range of species from protozoa to vertebrates. The proteins are not similar to known pore-forming proteins and thus could be unusual channels or regulatory components of a channel complex.                        ,              Cation channel genes encode for a transducer molecule that converts mechanical stimuli into cell signaling.           ,                             Mechanical stimuli drive many physiological processes, including touch and pain sensation, hearing, and blood pressure regulation. Mechanically activated (MA) cation channel activities have been recorded in many cells, but the responsible molecules have not been identified. We characterized a rapidly adapting MA current in a mouse neuroblastoma cell line. Expression profiling and RNA interference knockdown of candidate genes identified               Piezo1               (               Fam38A               ) to be required for MA currents in these cells. Piezo1 and related Piezo2 (Fam38B) are vertebrate multipass transmembrane proteins with homologs in invertebrates, plants, and protozoa. Overexpression of mouse Piezo1 or Piezo2 induced two kinetically distinct MA currents. Piezos are expressed in several tissues, and knockdown of Piezo2 in dorsal root ganglia neurons specifically reduced rapidly adapting MA currents. We propose that Piezos are components of MA cation channels.},

Here we explore the effects of exogenous alternating current (AC) fields across various amplitudes and frequencies on cortical slices expressing spontaneous slow oscillations. Cortical network entrainment occurs within an Arnold tongue-like region centered at the endogenous frequency. However, slightly detuned periodic stimulation of higher frequency leads to a desynchronized regime, revealing a novel approach for disrupting pathological synchronicity. The introduction of an additional direct current (DC) offset expands the modulatory ranges, facilitating the achievement of either entrainment or desynchronization, depending on the DC offset's polarity. The experimental observations are quantitatively reproduced by a computational model of spiking neurons, suggesting that the interaction between nonlinear oscillators can predict the network's response to AC fields. Besides an improved understanding of cortical dynamics and its interaction with exogenous electric fields, a robust protocol with potential clinical applications in pathological conditions is presented.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Mechanosensitive ion channels are force-transducing enzymes that couple mechanical stimuli to ion flux. Understanding the gating mechanism of mechanosensitive channels is challenging because the stimulus seen by the channel reflects forces shared between the membrane, cytoskeleton and extracellular matrix. Here we examine whether the mechanosensitive channel PIEZO1 is activated by force-transmission through the bilayer. To achieve this, we generate HEK293 cell membrane blebs largely free of cytoskeleton. Using the bacterial channel MscL, we calibrate the bilayer tension demonstrating that activation of MscL in blebs is identical to that in reconstituted bilayers. Utilizing a novel PIEZO1--GFP fusion, we then show PIEZO1 is activated by bilayer tension in bleb membranes, gating at lower pressures indicative of removal of the cortical cytoskeleton and the mechanoprotection it provides. Thus, PIEZO1 channels must sense force directly transmitted through the bilayer.},

Despite a growing literature of LIFU-induced behavioral modifications, the mechanisms of action supporting LIFU's parameter-dependent excitatory and suppressive effects are not fully understood. This review provides a comprehensive introduction to the underlying mechanics of both acoustic energy and neuronal membranes, defining the primary variables for a subsequent review of the field's proposed mechanisms supporting LIFU's neuromodulatory effects. An exhaustive review of the empirical literature was also conducted and studies were grouped based on the sonication parameters used and behavioral effects observed, with the goal of linking empirical findings to the proposed theoretical mechanisms and evaluating which model best fits the existing data. A neuronal intramembrane cavitation excitation model, which accounts for differential effects as a function of cell-type, emerged as a possible explanation for the range of excitatory effects found in the literature. The suppressive and other findings need additional theoretical mechanisms and these theoretical mechanisms need to have established relationships to sonication parameters.},

So far, there is no consensus regarding how cells respond to such external stimuli, although it reveals much about their internal structures, motility as well as the emergence of disorders. Here, we report that twelve cell lines, ranging from healthy fibroblasts to cancer cells, hold a ubiquitous double power-law viscoelastic relaxation compatible with the fractional Kelvin-Voigt viscoelastic model. Atomic Force Microscopy measurements in time domain were employed to determine the mechanical parameters, namely, the fast and slow relaxation exponents, the crossover timescale between power law regimes, and the cell stiffness. These cell-dependent quantities show strong correlation with their collective migration and invasiveness properties. Beyond that, the crossover timescale sets the fastest timescale for cells to perform their biological functions.},

Neurophysiol. 79: 999--1016, 1998. Early studies have shown that spindle oscillations are generated in the thalamus and are synchronized over wide cortical territories. More recent experiments have shown that this large-scale synchrony depends on the integrity of corticothalamic feedback. Previously proposed mechanisms emphasized exclusively intrathalamic mechanisms to generate the synchrony of these oscillations. In the present paper, we propose a cellular mechanism in which the synchrony is dependent of a mutual interaction between cortex and thalamus. This cellular mechanism is tested by computational models consisting of pyramidal cells, interneurons, thalamic reticular (RE) and thalamocortical (TC) relay cells, on the basis of voltage-clamp data on intrinsic currents and synaptic receptors present in the circuitry. The model suggests that corticothalamic feedback must operate on the thalamus mainly through excitation of GABAergic RE neurons, therefore recruiting relay cells essentially through inhibition and rebound. We provide experimental evidence for such dominant inhibition in the lateral posterior nucleus. In these conditions, the model shows that cortical discharges optimally evoked thalamic oscillations. This feature is essential to the present cellular mechanism and is also consistently observed experimentally. The model further shows that, with this type of corticothalamic feedback, cortical discharges recruited large areas of the thalamus because of the divergent cortex-to-RE and RE-to-TC axonal projections. Consequently, the thalamocortical network generated patterns of oscillations and synchrony similar to in vivo recordings. The model also emphasizes the important role of the modulation of the I               h               current by calcium in TC cells. This property conferred a relative refractoriness to the entire network, a feature also observed experimentally, as we show here. Further, the same property accounted for various spatiotemporal features of oscillations, such as systematic propagation after low-intensity cortical stimulation, local oscillations, and more generally, a high variability in the patterns of spontaneous oscillations, similar to in vivo recordings. We propose that the large-scale synchrony of spindle oscillations in vivo is the result of thalamocortical interactions in which the corticothalamic feedback acts predominantly through the RE nucleus. Several predictions are suggested to test the validity of this model.},

Despite growing interest in clinical applications, the safe and effective use of ultrasound neuromodulation has been limited by a lack of understanding of the physical mechanisms underlying its effects. Here, we demonstrate acoustic frequency-dependent physical effects that underlie ultrasound neuromodulation, where cavitation and radiation forces are the dominant sources of low- and high-frequency stimulation, respectively. We used 39.5 and 500 kHz acoustic frequencies to stimulate cultured neural and glial cells to study acoustic frequency-dependent neural responses. We demonstrate increased evoked responses due to increased cavitation activity at the 39.5 kHz acoustic frequency. In contrast, notable cavitation activity was not detected at 500 kHz despite detection of evoked responses. Our work highlights the dependence of ultrasound neuromodulation on acoustic frequencies, with different physical effects underlying cell responses to low and high sub-MHz acoustic frequency ranges.},

We varied [Ca2+]i from \&lt;10 to \&gt;400 nM with ionomycin (5 {$\mu$}M) added to either a 2 mM Ca2+, or EGTA-buffered Ca2+-free, solution. Coexpression of wt CaM made KCNQ2/3 currents highly sensitive to [Ca2+]i (IC50 70 \textpm{} 20 nM, max inhibition 73\%, n = 10). However, coexpression of DN CaM rendered KCNQ2/3 currents largely [Ca2+]i insensitive (max inhibition 8 \textpm{} 3\%, n = 10). In cells without cotransfected CaM, the Ca2+ sensitivity was variable but generally weak. [Ca2+]i modulation of M current in superior cervical ganglion (SCG) neurons followed the same pattern as in CHO cells expressed with KCNQ2/3 and wt CaM, suggesting that endogenous M current is also highly sensitive to [Ca2+]i. Coimmunoprecipitations showed binding of CaM to KCNQ2--5 that was similar in the presence of 5 mM Ca2+ or 5 mM EGTA. Gel-shift analyses suggested Ca2+-dependent CaM binding to an ``IQ-like'' motif present in the carboxy terminus of KCNQ2--5. We tested whether bradykinin modulation of M current in SCG neurons uses CaM. Wt or DN CaM was exogenously expressed in SCG cells using pseudovirions or the biolistic ``gene gun.'' Using both methods, expression of both wt CaM and DN CaM strongly reduced bradykinin inhibition of M current, but for all groups muscarinic inhibition was unaffected. Cells expressed with wt CaM had strongly reduced tonic current amplitudes as well. We observed similar [Ca2+]i rises by bradykinin in all the groups of cells, indicating that CaM did not affect Ca2+ release from stores. We conclude that M-type currents are highly sensitive to [Ca2+]i and that calmodulin acts as their Ca2+ sensor.},

  abstract = {1. To perform simulations of the various modes of action potential generation in thalamic relay neurons, we developed Hodgkin-and-Huxley style mathematical equations that describe the voltage dependence and kinetics of activation and inactivation of four different currents, including the transient, low-voltage-activated Ca2+ current (IT), the rapidly inactivating transient K+ current (IA), the slowly inactivating K+ current (IK2), and the hyperpolarization-activated, mixed cationic current (Ih). The modeled currents were derived either from acutely dissociated rat thalamic relay neurons (IT, IA, IK2), or from guinea pig thalamic relay cells maintained in slices in vitro (Ih). 2. The voltage dependence of steady-state activation and inactivation of IT, IA, and IK2 and the activation of Ih could be modeled with Boltzmann-style equations. Modeling of the behavior of IT to depolarizing steps in voltage clamp required the use of the constant field equation to relate permeability to T-current amplitude. The time constant of activation of IT was described by a continuous bell-shaped function with a maximum near 15 ms at threshold for activation (-75 mV) and 23 degrees C. Mathematical description of the kinetics of inactivation and removal of inactivation of this current required two separate functions. 3. The rapidly activating and inactivating K+ current IA was modeled by assuming two components with different time constants of inactivation. The kinetics of activation was described as a continuous function of voltage with the slowest time constant, near 2.5 ms, at threshold for activation (-60 mV) and 23 degrees C. In contrast, the kinetics of inactivation of both components were described as voltage independent, consistent with experimental data. The rate or removal of inactivation of both components of IA was described as continuously increasing with the degree of hyperpolarization. 4. The slowly inactivating K+ current IK2 was also modeled by assuming two components with different rates of inactivation. The kinetics of activation were described by a bell-shaped function with a maximum time constant near 80 ms at -40 mV and 23 degrees C, whereas threshold for activation was approximately -60 mV. Inactivation of both components was modeled as relatively independent of voltage, whereas removal of inactivation was described as a continuous function of membrane potential. 5. The hyperpolarization-activation cationic current, Ih, was modeled by assuming that the current activates with a single exponential relation and does not inactivate.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

  abstract = {To understand how electrical signal processing in cortical pyramidal neurons is executed by ion channels, it is essential to know their subcellular distribution. M-channels (encoded by Kv7.2--Kv7.5/KCNQ2--KCNQ5 genes) have multiple important functions in neurons, including control of excitability, spike afterpotentials, adaptation, and theta resonance. Nevertheless, the subcellular distribution of these channels has remained elusive. To determine the M-channel distribution within CA1 pyramidal neurons, we combined whole-cell patch-clamp recording from the soma and apical dendrite with focal drug application, in rat hippocampal slices. Both a M-channel opener (retigabine [               N               -(2-amino-4-(4-fluorobenzylamino)-phenyl) carbamic acid ethyl ester]) and a blocker (XE991 [10,10-bis(4-pyridinylmethyl)-9(10               H               )-antracenone]) changed the somatic subthreshold voltage response but had no observable effect on local dendritic responses. Under conditions promoting dendritic Ca               2+               spikes, local somatic but not dendritic application of M-channel blockers (linopirdine and XE991) enhanced the Ca               2+               spikes. Simultaneous dendritic and somatic whole-cell recordings showed that the medium afterhyperpolarization after a burst of spikes underwent strong attenuation along the apical dendrite and was fully blocked by somatic XE991 application. Finally, by combining patch-clamp and extracellular recordings with computer simulations, we found that perisomatic M-channels reduce the summation of EPSPs. We conclude that functional M-channels appear to be concentrated in the perisomatic region of CA1 pyramidal neurons, with no detectable M-channel activity in the distal apical dendrites.},

Current optogenetic approaches require invasive surgical procedures to deliver light of specific wavelengths to target cells to activate or silence them. Here, we demonstrate the use of low-pressure ultrasound as a non-invasive trigger to activate specific ultrasonically sensitized neurons in the nematode,               Caenorhabditis elegans               . We first show that wild-type animals are insensitive to low-pressure ultrasound and require gas-filled microbubbles to transduce the ultrasound wave. We find that neuron-specific misexpression of TRP-4, the pore-forming subunit of a mechanotransduction channel, sensitizes neurons to ultrasound stimulus, resulting in behavioural outputs. Furthermore, we use this approach to manipulate the function of sensory neurons and interneurons and identify a role for PVD sensory neurons in modifying locomotory behaviours. We suggest that this method can be broadly applied to manipulate cellular functions               in vivo               .},

  abstract = {Background:               Although low-intensity transcranial ultrasound stimulation (LI-TUS) has received more recognition for its neuromodulation potential, there remains a crucial knowledge gap regarding the neuromodulatory effects of LI-TUS and its potential for translation as a therapeutic tool in humans.                                         Objective:               In this review, we summarized the findings reported by recently published studies regarding the effect of LI-TUS on neuromodulation in both animals and humans. We also aim to identify challenges and opportunities for the translation process.                                         Methods:               A literature search of PubMed, Medline, EMBASE, and Web of Science was performed from January 2019 to June 2020 with the following keywords and Boolean operators: [transcranial ultrasound OR transcranial focused ultrasound OR ultrasound stimulation] AND [neuromodulation]. The methodological quality of the animal studies was assessed by the SYRCLE's risk of bias tool, and the quality of human studies was evaluated by the PEDro score and the NIH quality assessment tool.                                         Results:               After applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria, a total of 26 manuscripts (24 animal studies and two human studies) out of 508 reports were included in this systematic review. Although both inhibitory (10 studies) and excitatory (16 studies) effects of LI-TUS were observed in animal studies, only inhibitory effects have been reported in primates (five studies) and human subjects (two studies). The ultrasonic parameters used in animal and human studies are different. The SYRCLE quality score ranged from 25 to 43\%, with a majority of the low scores related to performance and detection bias. The two human studies received high PEDro scores (9/10).                                         Conclusion:               LI-TUS appears to be capable of targeting both superficial and deep cerebral structures to modulate cognitive or motor behavior in both animals and humans. Further human studies are needed to more precisely define the effective modulation parameters and thereby translate this brain modulatory tool into the clinic.},

The cellular-level model (termed ``bilayer sonophore'') combines the physics of bubble dynamics with cell biomechanics to determine the dynamic behavior of the two lipid bilayer membrane leaflets. The existence of such a unified model could potentially pave the way to a number of controlled ultrasound-assisted applications, including CNS modulation and blood--brain barrier permeabilization. The model predicts that the cellular membrane is intrinsically capable of absorbing mechanical energy from the ultrasound field and transforming it into expansions and contractions of the intramembrane space. It further predicts that the maximum area strain is proportional to the acoustic pressure amplitude and inversely proportional to the square root of the frequency (                                                              ) and is intensified by proximity to free surfaces, the presence of nearby microbubbles in free medium, and the flexibility of the surrounding tissue. Model predictions were experimentally supported using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) of multilayered live-cell goldfish epidermis exposed in vivo to continuous wave (CW) ultrasound at cavitational (1 MHz) and noncavitational (3 MHz) conditions. Our results support the hypothesis that ultrasonically induced bilayer membrane motion, which does not require preexistence of air voids in the tissue, may account for a variety of bioeffects and could elucidate mechanisms of ultrasound interaction with biological tissue that are currently not fully understood.},

  abstract = {Focused ultrasound has been shown to stimulate excitable cells, but the biophysical mechanisms behind this phenomenon remain poorly understood. To provide additional insight, we devised a behavioral-genetic assay applied to the well-characterized nervous system of               Caenorhabditis elegans               nematodes. We found that pulsed ultrasound elicits robust reversal behavior in wild-type animals in a pressure-, duration-, and pulse protocol-dependent manner. Responses were preserved in mutants unable to sense thermal fluctuations and absent in mutants lacking neurons required for mechanosensation. Additionally, we found that the worm's response to ultrasound pulses rests on the expression of MEC-4, a DEG/ENaC/ASIC ion channel required for touch sensation. Consistent with prior studies of MEC-4-dependent currents               in vivo               , the worm's response was optimal for pulses repeated 300--1000 times per second. Based on these findings, we conclude that mechanical, rather than thermal, stimulation accounts for behavioral responses. Further, we propose that acoustic radiation force governs the response to ultrasound in a manner that depends on the touch receptor neurons and MEC-4-dependent ion channels. Our findings illuminate a complete pathway of ultrasound action, from the forces generated by propagating ultrasound to an activation of a specific ion channel. The findings further highlight the importance of optimizing ultrasound pulsing protocols when stimulating neurons via ion channels with mechanosensitive properties.                                         SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT               How ultrasound influences neurons and other excitable cells has remained a mystery for decades. Although it is widely understood that ultrasound can heat tissues and induce mechanical strain, whether or not neuronal activation depends on heat, mechanical force, or both physical factors is not known. We harnessed               Caenorhabditis elegans               nematodes and their extraordinary sensitivity to thermal and mechanical stimuli to address this question. Whereas thermosensory mutants respond to ultrasound similar to wild-type animals, mechanosensory mutants were insensitive to ultrasound stimulation. Additionally, stimulus parameters that accentuate mechanical effects were more effective than those producing more heat. These findings highlight a mechanical nature of the effect of ultrasound on neurons and suggest specific ways to optimize stimulation protocols in specific tissues.},

  abstract = {Summary           Piezo1 is a mechanically activated ion channel that senses forces with short latency and high sensitivity. Piezos undergo large conformational changes, induce far-reaching deformation onto the membrane, and modulate the function of two-pore potassium (K2P) channels. Taken together, this led us to hypothesize that Piezos may be able to signal their conformational state to other nearby proteins. Here, we use chemical control to acutely restrict Piezo1 conformational flexibility and show that Piezo1 conformational changes, but not ion permeation through it, are required for modulating the K2P channel TREK1. Super-resolution imaging and stochastic simulations further reveal that both channels do not co-localize, which implies that modulation is not mediated through direct binding interactions; however, at high Piezo1 densities, most TREK1 channels are within the predicted Piezo1 membrane footprint, suggesting the footprint may underlie conformational signaling. We speculate that physiological roles originally attributed to Piezo1 ionotropic function could, alternatively, involve conformational signaling.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT             TRP channels of the transient receptor potential ion channel superfamily are involved in a wide variety of mechanosensory processes, including touch sensation, pain, blood pressure regulation, bone loading and detection of cerebrospinal fluid flow. However, in many instances it is unclear whether TRP channels are the primary transducers of mechanical force in these processes. In this study, we tested stretch activation of eleven TRP channels from six mammalian subfamilies. We found that these TRP channels were insensitive to short membrane stretches in cellular systems. Furthermore, we purified TRPC6 and demonstrated its insensitivity to stretch in liposomes, an artificial bilayer system free from cellular components. Additionally, we demonstrated that, when expressed in C. elegans neurons, mouse TRPC6 restores the mechanoresponse of a touch insensitive mutant but requires diacylglycerol for activation. These results strongly suggest that the mammalian members of the TRP ion channel family are insensitive to tension induced by cell membrane stretching and, thus, are more likely to be activated by cytoplasmic tethers or downstream components and to act as amplifiers of cellular mechanosensory signaling cascades.},

  abstract = {Conventional diagnostic ultrasound images portray differences in the acoustic properties of soft tissues, whereas ultrasound-based elasticity images portray differences in the elastic properties of soft tissues (i.e. stiffness, viscosity). The benefit of elasticity imaging lies in the fact that many soft tissues can share similar ultrasonic echogenicities, but may have different mechanical properties that can be used to clearly visualize normal anatomy and delineate pathological lesions. Acoustic radiation force-based elasticity imaging methods use acoustic radiation force to transiently deform soft tissues, and the dynamic displacement response of those tissues is measured ultrasonically and is used to estimate the tissue's mechanical properties. Both qualitative images and quantitative elasticity metrics can be reconstructed from these measured data, providing complimentary information to both diagnose and longitudinally monitor disease progression. Recently, acoustic radiation force-based elasticity imaging techniques have moved from the laboratory to the clinical setting, where clinicians are beginning to characterize tissue stiffness as a diagnostic metric, and commercial implementations of radiation force-based ultrasonic elasticity imaging are beginning to appear on the commercial market. This article provides an overview of acoustic radiation force-based elasticity imaging, including a review of the relevant soft tissue material properties, a review of radiation force-based methods that have been proposed for elasticity imaging, and a discussion of current research and commercial realizations of radiation force based-elasticity imaging technologies.},

Recently, intramembrane cavitation within the bilayer membrane was proposed to underlie both the biomechanics and the biophysics of acoustic bio-effects, potentially explaining cortical stimulation results through a neuronal intramembrane cavitation excitation (NICE) model. Here, NICE theory is shown to provide a detailed predictive explanation for the ability of ultrasonic (US) pulses to also suppress neural circuits through cell-type-selective mechanisms: according to the predicted mechanism T-type calcium channels boost charge accumulation between short US pulses selectively in low threshold spiking interneurons, promoting net cortical network inhibition. The theoretical results fit and clarify a wide array of earlier empirical observations in both the cortex and thalamus regarding the dependence of ultrasonic neuromodulation outcomes (excitation-suppression) on stimulation and network parameters. These results further support a unifying hypothesis for ultrasonic neuromodulation, highlighting the potential of advanced waveform design for obtaining cell-type-selective network control.},

  abstract = {Transient receptor potential (TRP) proteins are a diverse family of proteins with structural features typical of ion channels. TRPM5, a member of the TRPM subfamily, plays an important role in taste receptors, although its activation mechanism remains controversial and its function in signal transduction is unknown. Here we characterize the functional properties of heterologously expressed human TRPM5 in HEK-293 cells. TRPM5 displays characteristics of a calcium-activated, nonselective cation channel with a unitary conductance of 25 pS. TRPM5 is a monovalent-specific, nonselective cation channel that carries Na               +               , K               +               , and Cs               +               ions equally well, but not Ca               2+               ions. It is directly activated by [Ca               2+               ]               i               at concentrations of 0.3--1 {$\mu$}M, whereas higher concentrations are inhibitory, resulting in a bell-shaped dose--response curve. It activates and deactivates rapidly even during sustained elevations in [Ca               2+               ]               i               , thereby inducing a transient membrane depolarization. TRPM5 does not simply mirror levels of [Ca               2+               ]               i               , but instead responds to the rate of change in [Ca               2+               ]               i               in that it requires rapid changes in [Ca               2+               ]               i               to generate significant whole-cell currents, whereas slow elevations in [Ca               2+               ]               i               to equivalent levels are ineffective. Moreover, we demonstrate that TRPM5 is not limited to taste signal transduction, because we detect the presence of TRPM5 in a variety of tissues and we identify endogenous TRPM5-like currents in a pancreatic beta cell line. TRPM5 can be activated physiologically by inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-producing receptor agonists, and it may therefore couple intracellular Ca               2+               release to electrical activity and subsequent cellular responses.},

  abstract = {Ultrasound can modulate action potential firing in vivo and in vitro, but the mechanistic basis of this phenomenon is not well understood. To address this problem, we used patch-clamp recording to quantify the effects of focused, high-frequency (43 MHz) ultrasound on evoked action potential firing in CA1 pyramidal neurons in acute rodent hippocampal brain slices. We find that ultrasound can either inhibit or potentiate firing in a spike frequency--dependent manner: at low (near-threshold) input currents and low firing frequencies, ultrasound inhibits firing, while at higher input currents and higher firing frequencies, ultrasound potentiates firing. The net result of these two competing effects is that ultrasound increases the threshold current for action potential firing, the slope of frequency-input curves, and the maximum firing frequency. In addition, ultrasound slightly hyperpolarizes the resting membrane potential, decreases action potential width, and increases the depth of the after-hyperpolarization. All of these results can be explained by the hypothesis that ultrasound activates a sustained potassium conductance. According to this hypothesis, increased outward potassium currents hyperpolarize the resting membrane potential and inhibit firing at near-threshold input currents but potentiate firing in response to higher-input currents by limiting inactivation of voltage-dependent sodium channels during the action potential. This latter effect is a consequence of faster action potential repolarization, which limits inactivation of voltage-dependent sodium channels, and deeper (more negative) after-hyperpolarization, which increases the rate of recovery from inactivation. Based on these results, we propose that ultrasound activates thermosensitive and mechanosensitive two-pore-domain potassium (K2P) channels through heating or mechanical effects of acoustic radiation force. Finite-element modeling of the effects of ultrasound on brain tissue suggests that the effects of ultrasound on firing frequency are caused by a small (\&lt;2{$^\circ$}C) increase in temperature, with possible additional contributions from mechanical effects.},

Specialized mechanoreceptors such as the hair cells of the cochlea require elaborate mechanical impedance matching to couple the channels to the external stress. In contrast, MSCs in nonspecialized cells appear activated by stress in the bilayer local to the channel---within about three lipids. Local mechanical stress can be produced by far-field tension, amphipaths, phase separations, the cytoskeleton, the extracellular matrix, and the adhesion energy between the membrane and a patch pipette.

  abstract = {Abstract             Recent parallel studies clearly indicated that Merkel cells and the mechanosensitive piezo2 ion channel play critical roles in the light-touch somatosensation. Moreover, piezo2 was suggested to be a light-touch sensing ion channel without a role in pain sensing in mammals. However, biophysical characteristics of piezo2, such as single channel conductance and sensitivities to various mechanical stimuli, are unclear, hampering a precise understanding of its role in touch sensation. Here, we describe the biophysical properties of piezo2 in human Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC)-13 cells; piezo2 is a low-threshold, positive pressure-specific, curvature-sensitive, mechanically activated cation channel with a single channel conductance of \textasciitilde 28.6 pS. Application of step indentations under the whole-cell mode of the patch-clamp technique, and positive pressures {$\geq$}5\,mmHg under the cell-attached mode, activated piezo2 currents in MCC-13 and human embryonic kidney 293\,T cells where piezo2 was overexpressed. By contrast, application of a negative pressure failed to activate piezo2 in these cells, whereas both positive and negative pressure activated piezo1 in a similar manner. Our results are the first to demonstrate single channel recordings of piezo2. We anticipate that our findings will be a starting point for a more sophisticated understanding of piezo2 roles in light-touch sensation.},

While structural and functional studies have led to models that explain their mechanosensitivity, we lack a quantitative understanding of channel activation by membrane tension. Here, we define the tension response of mechanosensitive K2Ps using patch-clamp recording and imaging.

TRAAK is most sensitive, TREK-1 intermediate, and TREK-2 least sensitive. TRAAK and TREK-1 are activated broadly over a range encompassing nearly all physiologically~relevant tensions. TREK-2, in contrast, activates over a narrower range like mechanosensitive channels Piezo1, MscS, and MscL. We further show that~low-frequency, low-intensity focused ultrasound increases membrane tension to activate TRAAK and MscS.

  abstract = {Stretch-activated conductances are commonly encountered in careful electric recordings. Those of known proteins (TRP, MscL, MscS, K2p, Kv, etc.) all share a core, which houses the ion pathway and the gate, but no recognizable force-sensing domain. Like animal TRPs, the yeast TRPY1 is polymodal, activated by stretch force, Ca2+, etc. To test whether its S5--S6 core senses the stretch force, we tried to uncouple it from the peripheral domains by strategic peptide insertions to block the covalent core--periphery interactions. Insertion of long unstructured peptides should distort, if not disrupt, protein structures that transmit force. Such insertions between S6 and the C-terminal tail largely removed Ca2+ activation, showing their effectiveness. However, such insertions as well as those between S5 and the N-terminal region, which includes S1--S4, did not significantly alter mechanosensitivity. Even insertions at both locations flanking the S5--S6 core did not much alter mechanosensitivity. Tryptophan scanning mutations in S5 were also constructed to perturb possible noncovalent core--periphery contacts. The testable tryptophan mutations also have little or no effects on mechanosensitivity. Boltzmann fits of the wild-type force--response curves agree with a structural homology model for a stretch-induced core expansion of {$\sim$}2 nm2 upon opening. We hypothesize that membrane tension pulls on S5--S6, expanding the core and opening the TRPY1 gate. The core being the major force sensor offers the simplest, though not the only, explanation of why so many channels of disparate designs are mechanically sensitive. Compared with the bacterial MscL, TRPY1 is much less sensitive to force, befitting a polymodal channel that relies on multiple stimuli.},

It is shown that neuronal and fibroblast membranes deflect about 150 nm upon ultrasound stimulation. Next, a biomechanical model that predicts changes in membrane voltage after ultrasound exposure is developed. Finally, the model predictions are validated using whole-cell patch clamp electrophysiology on primary neurons. Collectively, it is shown that ultrasound stimulation directly defects the neuronal membrane leading to a change in membrane voltage and subsequent depolarization. The model is consistent with existing data and provides a mechanism for both ultrasound-evoked neurostimulation and sonogenetic control.},

However, the biomolecular and cellular mechanisms by which focused ultrasound excites mammalian neurons have remained unclear, posing significant challenges for the use of this technology in research and potential clinical applications. Here, we show that focused ultrasound excites primary murine cortical neurons in culture through a primarily mechanical mechanism mediated by specific calcium-selective mechanosensitive ion channels. The activation of these channels results in a gradual build-up of calcium, which is amplified by calcium- and voltage-gated channels, generating a burst firing response. Cavitation, temperature changes, large-scale deformation, and synaptic transmission are not required for this excitation to occur. Pharmacological and genetic inhibition of specific ion channels leads to reduced responses to ultrasound, while over-expressing these channels results in stronger ultrasonic stimulation. These findings provide a mechanistic explanation for the effect of ultrasound on neurons to facilitate the further development of ultrasonic neuromodulation and sonogenetics as tools for neuroscience research.},
